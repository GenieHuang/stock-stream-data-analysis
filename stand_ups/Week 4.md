1. **What have you done in the past week
   In the past week, I completed the data extraction process. The next step is to load the data into Spark, where I will do some transformations before loading it into the database.

2. **Challenges
   I didn’t face any major challenges, but I did find it difficult to organize the file structure in a way that makes the program more scalable and easier to maintain.

3. **What will you do for next week.
   Next week, I will focus on data transformation. I’ll also begin to work on a basic plan for the next steps after completing the data pipeline, after I have all the real time data I need. And maybe it will be about an interactive dashboard to showcase the real time data and prediction of future stock price. I’ll try to predict the price with both the current price and financial news.
