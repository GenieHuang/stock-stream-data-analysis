Stand up:

1. Data transformation with Pyspark
2. Testing the time series databases

Started with InfluxDB, but I only have $250 credits for only one month. But as far as I know the cassendra db is for free. I only tested InfluxDB last week, and this week I will test Cassendra to see if it can meet my requirement and with lower pricing. Also, I will keep trying other more common no-sql databases like  MongoDB.
