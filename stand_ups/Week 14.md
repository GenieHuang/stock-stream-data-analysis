During the fall break, I successfully connected my S3 bucket to Athena. It was unexpectedly smooth at the beginning, but when I checked the preview of the data stream using Athena, I found it was empty. This meant that Kafka and Spark were sending an empty data stream with only the data structure. I investigated and found out the issue: the Airflow task to request the API data runs daily, so Kafka cannot continuously produce messages, which means the data. To fix this, I plan to adjust my Airflow DAGs and maybe use a Kubernetes container to keep the data extraction process running every minute.

Apart from this, my plan for next week is to connect Athena to a business intelligence tool so I can create visualizations with the real-time data flow. I decided to use Grafana because Iâ€™ve seen several real-time dashboards built with it, and they are amazing. I plan to do the same. My goal is to connect Athena to Grafana directly, test the entire process, and complete the final step of building the dashboard next week.
