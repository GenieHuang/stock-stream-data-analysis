Last week, I spent some time on researching the best data warehouse solution after loading data into AWS S3. Now, I can see the data in my S3 bucket, but I can’t query it yet. At first, I planned to connect S3 directly to AWS Athena, but that is not the best practice, a bit expensive. Instead, I’m thinking of using a web crawler to load the data into a Glue database first, then send it to Athena for querying.

Last week wasn’t too challenging since I was just doing research. But next week, I’ll start putting everything into practice. I assume I would face a lot of challenges next week, especially since I’m not very familiar with Athena. Still, I want to try Athena first because it’s much cheaper than using Redshift. Redshift is another easier but high-cost data warehouse.
