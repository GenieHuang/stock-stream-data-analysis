Have done:

1. Started to use Jira for project management and entered the basic framework and timeline of my project. From now on, I will follow the timeline and issues in kanban board to improve the development effiency.
2. Searched for the suitable stock market API for data extraction. I have to consider the price and functionality of the API. Finally I decided to use Alpaca API for the basic stock market price data.

Challenges:
1. I met some error with my Amazon EC2 instance. I suddenly couldn't use SSH to connect. So I had to create another instance and migrate my scripts to the new one, to bypass this issue.

However, I guess the reason why causing this issue is because I tried to download files from my instance to my local machine, which triggers the firewall.

Next step:
I will follow the kanban board and wrap up the data extraction part.
